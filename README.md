# TelemetryDeck SDK for Go

**The development on this project has just started. Please don't expect anything to work until there are a few releases. Also please expect breaking API changes in every release until v1.0.0 is reached.**

The Goal of this library is to facilitate sending telemetry data to the [TelemetryDeck](https://telemetrydeck.com/) backend via the [Ingest API v2](https://telemetrydeck.com/docs/ingest/v2/).
